  <meta name="description" content="Hi there! I am a graduate student at Imperial College London pursuing an MSc in Computing with specialism in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Recently, I joined the [Brain and Behaviour Lab](https://faisallab.org/) working under the supervision of Professor Aldo Faisal on Reinforcement Learning control. 

  I have a diverse set of interests. Currently, I am particularly interested in how we can leverage our understanding of human locomotion to develop better control algorithms. 
  In parallel to my MSc Thesis, I am also working with Dr Julia Ive in the [NLP group](https://lama.doc.ic.ac.uk/) on multi-modal neural language models and transfer learning. After graduating from ETH Zurich with a BSc in Civil Engineering, I took
  a gap year where I worked at Amazon as a Research Scientist intern on large scale supervised learning algorithms and capacity optimisation. I also had the chance to work as a Venture Capital intern at [Global Founders Capital](https://www.globalfounderscapital.com/) 
  where I sourced deals around the world and met some awesome Startup founders! My first internship after graduating was at [construyo](https://www.construyo.de/), 
  where I helped Fabian and Leonhard towards their mission to digitize the construction industry. Feel free to reach out!
