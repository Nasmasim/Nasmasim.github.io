  <meta name="description" content="Hi there! I am a graduate student at Imperial College London pursuing an MSc in Computing with specialism in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Recently, I joined the [Brain and Behaviour Lab](https://faisallab.org/) working under the supervision of Professor Aldo Faisal on Reinforcement Learning control. 

  I have a diverse set of interests spanning from developing a theoretical understanding of reinforcement learning algorithms, to natural language processing and uncertainty estimations in complex dynamical systems. Previously, I worked at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) 
  as a Research Scientist and in Venture Capital at [Global Founders Capital](https://www.globalfounderscapital.com/). Feel free to reach out!

<p>Hi there! I am a graduate student at Imperial College London pursuing an MSc in Computing with specialism in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Recently, I joined the <a href="https://faisallab.org/">Brain and Behaviour Lab</a> working under the supervision of Professor Aldo Faisal on Reinforcement Learning control.</p>
<p>I have a diverse set of interests. Currently, I am particularly interested in how we can leverage our
understanding of human locomotion to develop better control algorithms. In parallel to my MSc Thesis, I am also working with Dr Julia Ive in the <a href="https://lama.doc.ic.ac.uk/">NLP group</a>
on multi-modal neural language models and transfer learning.</p>
<p>After graduating from ETH Zurich with a BSc in Civil Engineering,
I worked at Amazon as a Research Scientist intern on large scale
supervised learning algorithms and capacity optimisation. I also had the chance to work
as a Venture Capital intern at <a href="https://www.globalfounderscapital.com">Global Founders Capital</a>
where I sourced deals around the world and met some awesome Startup founders!
My first internship after graduating was at <a href="https://www.construyo.de/">construyo</a>, where I helped Fabian and Leonhard towards their mission to digitize the construction industry.</p>
